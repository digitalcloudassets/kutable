  # Fix Messaging RLS Policies for Barber-Client Chat

  This migration fixes the row-level security policies for the messages table to enable
  proper messaging between barbers and clients.

  ## Issues Addressed
  1. Complex INSERT policy was preventing message creation
  2. Overly restrictive validation logic in WITH CHECK clause
  3. Failed joins in RLS policy context

  ## New Policies
  1. Simple INSERT policy: users can only send messages as themselves
  2. Simple SELECT policy: users can read messages they sent or received
  3. Keep existing UPDATE policy for marking messages as read

  ## Security
  - Users can only send messages with their own user_id as sender_id
  - Users can only read messages where they are sender or receiver
  - Validation that users are part of the booking is handled by application logic
*/

-- Drop existing complex policies that are causing issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert messages for their bookings only" ON messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages they sent or received" ON messages;

-- Create simple, robust policies

-- Allow users to read messages they sent or received
CREATE POLICY "Users can read their own messages"
  ON messages
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    auth.uid() = sender_id OR auth.uid() = receiver_id
  );

-- Allow users to send messages (with sender_id validation)
CREATE POLICY "Users can send messages as themselves"
  ON messages
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (
    auth.uid() = sender_id
  );

-- Keep the existing UPDATE policy (it's working fine)
-- "Users can update read status of messages sent to them" already exists

-- Also ensure the table has proper indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_sender_receiver ON messages (sender_id, receiver_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_messages_booking_created ON messages (booking_id, created_at DESC);
